How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Isolating bad code, debugging, being able to go through the development of your programs in order to refine the process.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?	

	pros: neater, easier to keep track of, less waste
	cons: forgetting to save, some kind of disaster prevents saving

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because changes to code often times spans multiple files
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	because I know that I can go back to how it was.
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
