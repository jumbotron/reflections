When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

		Multiple contributors, as a failsafe, in order to resume working on different machines.  
	  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		Someone else may have contributed things that i do not wish to have on my remote. I'd like to keep control of this.\
		
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

		Clones are copies of a repository that are made on remote machines whereas forks are copies made on GitHub.
		Branches are series of commits in a repository.  
		Use branch when working on changes to a repository, clone when you want a copy of repository on your machine, 
		and fork when you want to copy someone else's repository to your account on GitHub.
		
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

		The benefit is being able to merge your repositories when changes are made remotely and locally.  Otherwise 
		collaboration on GitHub would be very difficult.
